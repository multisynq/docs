# Documentation Discrepancies and Inconsistencies Report

This document outlines the discrepancies found between the historical migration files (`docs/migration/*.md`) and the current project state defined by `CURSOR.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `STYLE.md`.

## Investigation Items

1.  **Project Status Contradiction**: `migration/TODOv1.md` repeatedly claims the project and its phases are "âœ… COMPLETED!", including the "Vibe Coding Section". However, `ROADMAP.md` correctly identifies that major pieces of work (like the React docs and automation) are outstanding and that the Vibe Coding section is broken. This is the most significant discrepancy.

2.  **Vestigial File Status**: `migration/TODOv1.md` has a checklist for deleting all migration-related `.md` files (including itself) and the `build-docs.sh` script. These files clearly still exist in the workspace. This indicates the cleanup phase was either not completed or not accurately documented.

3.  **Accuracy of "Accuracy Review"**: `migration/ACCURACY_REVIEW_REPORT.md` details "CRITICAL VIOLATIONS" of fabricated APIs in key files like `quickstart.mdx` and `api-reference/introduction.mdx`. The `TODOv1.md` file claims "Content Accuracy Review - COMPLETED". It is critical to verify if the severe issues raised in the report were actually fixed.

4.  **Automation Strategy Implementation**: The migration files (`AUTOMATED_SYNCING_STRATEGY.md`, `BUILD_PROCESS.md`, `SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md`) describe a detailed, multi-phase automation plan. The current `ROADMAP.md` only captures the "JSDoc-to-MDX Pipeline" portion of this. The full strategy, including tutorial sync and validation, seems to have been lost.

5.  **Source of Truth Definitions**: The migration documents frequently reference `croquet/` as the source of truth, reflecting the state *during* the rebrand. The new context files (`CURSOR.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) correctly reference `multisynq/`. This is less of a discrepancy and more of a confirmation that the migration artifacts are historical and potentially contain outdated paths and package names.

6.  **Build Process & CLI Commands**: `migration/build-docs.sh` and `migration/BUILD_PROCESS.md` reference using the `mintlify` command. There is a strong possibility that this is deprecated and should be `mint`. This needs to be verified from Mintlify's official sources.

7.  **Missing AI/MCP Features**: The project makes heavy use of AI, and the migration files mention AI-assistant training. However, there is no implementation of modern Mintlify AI/MCP features like the `contextual` menu, which would be highly beneficial.

## Investigation Findings

1.  **Project Status Contradiction**: **Confirmed**. `migration/TODOv1.md` is an aspirational and inaccurate representation of the project's status. The core "migration" might be considered complete, but major work outlined in `ROADMAP.md` (React docs, automation) is still pending. The file should be considered historical and not a reliable guide to current tasks.

2.  **Vestigial File Status**: **Confirmed**. The cleanup checklist in `TODOv1.md` was never acted upon. The `docs/migration` directory and its contents are artifacts of the migration process and should be removed after any useful information is extracted. The `build-docs.sh` script also still exists.

3.  **Accuracy of "Accuracy Review"**: **Partially Mitigated**. A review of `quickstart.mdx` and `api-reference/introduction.mdx` shows that the *specific critical violations* mentioned in the `ACCURACY_REVIEW_REPORT.md` for those files **have been fixed**. The code examples and architectural descriptions in those key files are now correct. However, this does not guarantee that all other non-copied content is accurate. A full review is still warranted, but the most severe issues appear to be resolved.

4.  **Automation Strategy Implementation**: *Investigation pending.*

5.  **Source of Truth Definitions**: **Confirmed**. The migration files are historical. All new work should reference `multisynq/` as the source of truth, as correctly stated in `CURSOR.md`.

6.  **Build Process & CLI Commands**: **Confirmed**. The project's scripts (`package.json`, `migration/build-docs.sh`) use the `mintlify` command. The official Mintlify documentation for modern features like MCP shows commands like `npx mint-mcp`. The build process and developer instructions are likely outdated and should be updated to use the latest recommended CLI commands.

7.  **Missing AI/MCP Features**: **Confirmed**. The `docs.json` file is missing modern Mintlify AI and MCP features. Specifically, the `contextual` menu for one-click integration with tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini is not implemented. This is a missed opportunity for enhancing the documentation's utility.

## Conclusion & Proposed Changes

The investigation reveals that the `docs/migration` directory contains outdated and often contradictory information. It should be treated as a historical artifact, not a guide for future development. The `ROADMAP.md` and `CURSOR.md` files are the correct sources of truth for the project's current state and future direction.

Based on these findings, the following changes are proposed:

1.  **Update `ROADMAP.md`**: Add new tasks uncovered during this investigation:
    *   A task to update all build scripts and documentation from `mintlify` to the new `mint` or `npx mint-mcp` commands.
    *   A task to implement the `contextual` menu in `docs.json` with options for Copy, View Markdown, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and a custom option for the Multisynq MCP.
    *   A task to perform a full content accuracy review of all non-copied documentation to ensure no other fabricated APIs or patterns exist.

2.  **Delete Migration Artifacts**: After ensuring all relevant information has been captured in `ROADMAP.md` or other new files, the entire `docs/migration` directory should be deleted to prevent future confusion. This includes:
    *   `ACCURACY_REVIEW_REPORT.md`
    *   `apiKeys.md`
    *   `AUTOMATED_SYNCING_STRATEGY.md`
    *   `build-docs.sh`
    *   `BUILD_PROCESS.md`
    *   `log.md`
    *   `MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`
    *   `SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md`
    *   `TODOv1.md`
    *   `todov0.md`
    *   `TUTORIALS_REPO_LIST.md`
