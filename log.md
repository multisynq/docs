the multisynq.io docs are in the process of           │
│   migration. placeholder values for all the pages are   │
│   currently used. finish the migration of all           │
│   multisynq.io frontend docs to the docs/ mintlify      │
│   repo such that all text/implementation steps values   │
│   params etc are correct, all links work, all demos     │
│   work, all branding is consistent and the readme.md    │
│   is accurate and build steps work. youll need to       │
│   review the multisynq-client/docs and croquet-docs     │
│   repos, the latter contains jsdoc global/view/model    │
│   classes/api and the former contains tutorials. we     │
│   also need the react-together documentation in the     │
│   mintlify docs. first do a full /init with all         │
│   necessary info, paths/repos/resources and             │
│   implementation steps listed, then execute

 save the full init report to relevant md files. make  │
│   sure all information including repo structure,        │
│   paths/folders, build process, jsdoc info, etc is      │
│   included. make sure implementation plan is fully      │
│   documented separately as TODO.md. document            │
│   everything you've learned then execute the            │
│   migration. Make sure to document how to generate the  │
│   docs in the future and WHERE SOURCES OF TRUTH ARE     │
│   eg right now they are in croquet/croquet for the      │
│   classes - croquet is being rebranded to multisynq -   │
│   so eventually the jsdoc generation will change. how   │
│   can we automate inclusion of the jsdoc text/docs      │
│   into these mintlify docs?
