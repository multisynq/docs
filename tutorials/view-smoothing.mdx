# View Smoothing

This tutorial demonstrates how to smooth the view so that objects move continually even if the model only updates intermittently. This technique is essential for creating smooth user experiences and handling connectivity issues gracefully.

## Try it out!

Click or scan the QR code above to launch a new CodePen instance. You'll see several moving colored dots - one for each device currently connected to the session. Some dots may even belong to other Multisynq developers reading this documentation!

**Click or tap the screen** to tell your dot where to go.

<Info>
**The unsmoothed position of your dot is shown in gray.** Notice how it jumps forward every time the model performs an update. The view uses this information to calculate each dot's smoothed position.
</Info>

In this example, the model updates only **twice per second**, but the dots move smoothly at 60 frames per second because the view interpolates their position between model updates.

</CardGroup>

## Global Constants

Constants used by the model should be included in the session hash to ensure synchronization. Changing these constants will create a new session, preventing desynchronization issues.

```javascript
const Q = Multisynq.Constants;
Q.TICK_MS = 500;    // milliseconds per actor tick
Q.SPEED = 0.15;     // dot movement speed in pixels per millisecond
Q.CLOSE = 0.1;      // minimum distance in pixels to a new destination
Q.SMOOTH = 0.05;    // weighting between old and new positions (0 < SMOOTH <= 1)
```

<Info>
`Multisynq.Constants` contributes to the hash used to generate a session ID. Use a short alias like `Q` to make your code more readable.
</Info>

## Pure Functions

You can safely share utility functions between model and view as long as they are **purely functional**:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return { x: (a.x + b.x), y: (a.y + b.y) };
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return { x: (a.x - b.x), y: (a.y - b.y) };
}

function magnitude(vector) {
    return Math.sqrt(vector.x * vector.x + vector.y * vector.y);
}

function normalize(vector) {
    const mag = magnitude(vector);
    return { x: vector.x / mag, y: vector.y / mag };
}

function scale(vector, factor) {
    return { x: vector.x * factor, y: vector.y * factor };
}

function dotProduct(a, b) {
    return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y;
}

function lerp(a, b, t) {
    return { x: a.x + (b.x - a.x) * t, y: a.y + (b.y - a.y) * t };
}
```

### Pure Function Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No External Dependencies">
    Function only uses parameters passed to it
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Parameter Modification">
    Function doesn't modify input parameters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No State Persistence">
    Function doesn't save state outside its execution scope
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consistent Results">

<Warning>
Pure function code isn't included in the session ID hash. If you change these functions frequently, ensure all users have the same version to maintain synchronization.
</Warning>

## Actor-Pawn Architecture

### RootModel & RootView

The root classes handle spawning and managing Actor-Pawn pairs:

- **User joins**: `RootModel` spawns an `Actor`, which tells `RootView` to spawn a `Pawn`
- **User exits**: `RootModel` removes the `Actor`, which tells `RootView` to remove the `Pawn`

#### View Initialization Pattern

```javascript
// In RootView constructor
model.actors.forEach(actor => this.addPawn(actor));
```

<Info>
During initialization, the view should never assume the model's current state. Always read the model state and build accordingly, as the view might be joining a session in progress or restoring from a snapshot.
</Info>

### Actor Implementation

#### Movement Planning

```javascript
goto(goal) {
    this.goal = goal;
    const delta = subtract(goal, this.position);
    if (magnitude(delta) < Q.CLOSE) {
        this.goto(randomPosition());
    } else {
        const unit = normalize(delta);
        this.velocity = scale(unit, Q.SPEED);
    }
}
```

The `goto` method calculates movement vectors:
1. Check if already at destination (within `Q.CLOSE` distance)
2. If too close, pick a new random destination
3. Otherwise, calculate velocity vector toward the goal

#### Arrival Detection

```javascript
arrived() {
    const delta = subtract(this.goal, this.position);
    return (dotProduct(this.velocity, delta) <= 0);
}
```

Since actors step forward fixed distances and usually overshoot goals, arrival is detected by checking if the direction to the goal has reversed (negative dot product).

#### Animation Loop

```javascript
tick() {
    this.position = add(this.position, scale(this.velocity, Q.TICK_MS));
    if (this.arrived()) this.goto(this.randomPosition());
    this.publish(this.id, "moved", this.now());
    this.future(Q.TICK_MS).tick();
}
```

Each tick:
1. Move forward by velocity × tick duration
2. Check if arrived and pick new destination if needed
3. Notify view that actor has moved
4. Schedule next tick

## Pawn Implementation

### Constructor with Frame Limiting

```javascript
constructor(actor) {
    super(actor);
    this.actor = actor;
    this.position = {...actor.position};
    this.actorMoved();
    this.subscribe(actor.id, {event: "moved", handling: "oncePerFrame"}, this.actorMoved);
}
```

Key features:
- Copy initial position from actor
- Subscribe to actor's movement events
- Use `"oncePerFrame"` to optimize event handling

<Info>
`"oncePerFrame"` discards all but the last event of this type during each frame. This is crucial for high-frequency updates where only the latest position matters.
</Info>

### Event Handling

```javascript
actorMoved() {
    this.lastMoved = viewTime;
}
```

Simply timestamps when the actor last moved, enabling position extrapolation.

### Smooth Animation Update

```javascript
update() {
    // Special case for own pawn - show debug info
    if (this.actor.viewId === this.viewId) {
        this.draw(this.actor.goal, null, this.actor.color);
        this.draw(this.actor.position, "lightgrey");
    }

    // Calculate extrapolated position
    const delta = scale(this.actor.velocity, viewTime - this.lastMoved);
    const extrapolation = add(this.actor.position, delta);
    
    // Interpolate between current and extrapolated position
    this.position = lerp(this.position, extrapolation, Q.SMOOTH);
    this.draw(this.position, this.actor.color);
}
```

The smoothing algorithm:
1. **Extrapolate**: Project actor's last known position forward using velocity
2. **Interpolate**: Blend current pawn position with extrapolated position
3. **Render**: Draw the smoothed position

### Understanding the Smoothing Parameter

The `Q.SMOOTH` value (0 < SMOOTH ≤ 1) controls interpolation behavior:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="SMOOTH = 1.0" icon="bolt">
    No interpolation - instant position updates (jerky)
  </Card>
  <Card title="SMOOTH = 0.5" icon="balance-scale">
    Balanced smoothing - good responsiveness
  </Card>
  <Card title="SMOOTH = 0.1" icon="feather">
    Heavy smoothing - very smooth but less responsive
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Rule of thumb**: Tune `Q.SMOOTH` so the pawn spends about half its time behind the actor's position and half ahead. This provides optimal balance between smoothness and responsiveness.
</Note>

## Reflector Heartbeat Configuration

### Setting Tick Rate

```javascript
Multisynq.Session.join({
  apiKey: "your_api_key",
  appId: "io.codepen.multisynq.smooth",
  name: "public",
  password: "none",
  model: RootModel,
  view: RootView,
  tps: 1000/Q.TICK_MS,  // or simply: tps: 2
});
```

The `tps` (ticks per second) option controls reflector heartbeat frequency:
- **Purpose**: Keeps model running when no user input is received
- **Default**: 20 ticks per second
- **Range**: 1-60 ticks per second
- **Best Practice**: Match your model's internal tick rate

<Info>
In this tutorial, `Q.TICK_MS = 500` means the reflector sends heartbeat ticks twice per second maximum. Set heartbeat rate to match your model's update frequency.
</Info>

### Heartbeat vs Responsiveness

<Warning>
Increasing heartbeat tick rate will **NOT** make your app more responsive. User input events are sent immediately and processed as soon as received. Heartbeat ticks only affect model updates when no other events are received.
</Warning>

### Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
