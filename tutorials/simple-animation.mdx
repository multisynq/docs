description: "Learn to create multi-user shared animations and interactions with bouncing balls simulation"
---

This tutorial teaches you how to create multi-user shared animations and interactions using Multisynq. You'll build a simulation with 25 bouncing balls that can be stopped and started by clicking them. This demonstrates how the Model computes simulations and how the View displays and interacts with them.

## Try it out!

Click or scan the QR code above to launch a new CodePen instance of this session. Compare the two sessions - you'll see that the animated simulations are identical. The balls all move and bounce exactly the same way.

## Architecture Overview

This application uses **two Multisynq Model subclasses**: `MyModel` and `BallModel`. Both classes must be registered with Multisynq for proper synchronization.

### Using Multisynq Constants

The app uses `Multisynq.Constants` to ensure all users share the same configuration values:

```javascript
const Q = Multisynq.Constants;
Q.BALL_NUM = 25;              // how many balls do we want?
Q.STEP_MS = 1000 / 30;        // bouncing ball tick interval in ms
Q.SPEED = 10;                 // max speed on a dimension, in units/s
```

<Info>
Models must not use global variables, but global constants are fine. `Multisynq.Constants` is recursively frozen once a session starts to prevent accidental modification.
</Info>

## Simple Animation Model

### MyModel - Root Model

`MyModel` is the root model passed to `Multisynq.Session.join()`. It creates and stores the `BallModel` objects in the `MyModel.children` array.

### BallModel - Individual Ball Logic

Each `BallModel` represents a shaped, colored, bouncing ball. The model stores only the data needed for synchronization:

- **Shape**: String (`'circle'` or `'roundRect'`)
- **Color**: Random color value
- **Position**: Current x,y coordinates  
- **Speed**: Velocity vector

#### Event Subscription

```javascript
this.subscribe(this.id, 'touch-me', this.startStop);
```

Each `BallModel` subscribes to the `'touch-me'` event using its own ID as scope. This ensures that only the specific ball responds to touch events intended for it.

#### Simulation Loop

```javascript
this.future(Q.STEP_MS).step();
```

After initialization, each `BallModel` schedules its first `step()` method invocation. This creates a continuous simulation loop:

```javascript
BallModel.step() {
    if (this.alive) this.moveBounce();
    this.future(Q.STEP_MS).step();
}
```

<Note>
25 balls ticking at 30Hz generates 750 messages per second, but future messages are very efficient with minimal overhead.
</Note>

#### Movement and Bouncing

```javascript
BallModel.moveBounce() {
    const [x, y] = this.pos;
    if (x<=0 || x>=1000 || y<=0 || y>=1000)
        this.speed = this.randomSpeed();
    this.moveTo([x + this.speed[0], y + this.speed[1]]);
}
```

The `moveBounce()` method updates ball position and handles wall collisions. When a ball hits a wall, it gets a new random speed vector.

#### Deterministic Random Speed

```javascript
randomSpeed() {
    const xs = this.random() * 2 - 1;
    const ys = this.random() * 2 - 1;
    const speedScale = Q.SPEED / (Math.sqrt(xs*xs + ys*ys));
    return [xs * speedScale, ys * speedScale];
}
```

<Warning>
This uses Multisynq's replicated random number generator. Every session instance computes the same sequence of random numbers, ensuring identical bouncing behavior across all users.
</Warning>

## Simple Animation View

The View comprises two classes: `MyView` and `BallView`.

### MyView - Container View

`MyView` is called when a session instance starts, receiving the `MyModel` object as an argument. It builds the visual representation and container for all balls.

#### Creating Child Views

```javascript
model.children.forEach(child => this.attachChild(child));
```

The `MyView` accesses the model's children collection and creates a `BallView` for each `BallModel`.

```javascript
MyView.attachChild(child) {
    this.element.appendChild(new BallView(child).element);
}
```

<Info>
It's fine for views to **read** from models directly, but views **MUST NOT** modify models in any way.
</Info>

#### Responsive Scaling

`MyView` listens for browser "resize" events and adjusts the view scale accordingly. This ensures all users see the same scene regardless of their window size.

#### Cleanup on Detach

```javascript
MyView.detach() {
    super.detach();
    let child;
    while (child = this.element.firstChild) this.element.removeChild(child);
}
```

When a session shuts down, the root view cleans up all child views and resources.

### BallView - Individual Ball Display

Each `BallView` tracks its associated `BallModel` and handles visual representation and user interaction.

#### Position Updates

```javascript
this.subscribe(model.id, { event: 'pos-changed', handling: "oncePerFrame" }, this.move);
```

The `BallView` subscribes to `'pos-changed'` events from its specific model. The `"oncePerFrame"` handling ensures efficient rendering even with multiple position updates per frame.

#### Touch/Click Handling

```javascript
BallView.enableTouch() {
    const el = this.element;
    if (TOUCH) el.ontouchstart = start => {
        start.preventDefault();
        this.publish(el.id, 'touch-me');
    }; else el.onmousedown = start => {
        start.preventDefault();
        this.publish(el.id, 'touch-me');
    };
}
```

The `BallView` sets up touch/click handlers that publish `'touch-me'` events. The corresponding `BallModel` subscribes to these events and toggles ball motion on and off.
