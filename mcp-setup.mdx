## Multisynq Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

You can install the Multisynq MCP server to connect AI applications and large language models directly to the Multisynq platform's functions.

### Installation

To install the server, run the command provided by the contextual menu, or copy and paste the following into your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx mint-mcp add multisynq.io
```
</CodeGroup>

When you run the command, you will be prompted for two API keys:
- `External Admin Key`
- `Assistant API Key`

You can find these keys in your Mintlify dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

### Available Tools

Once configured, your MCP server will be ready to use. It includes the `search` tool by default, which allows you to query information across this entire documentation site.

If the project's OpenAPI specification is configured with the `x-mcp` extension, those API functions will also be available as tools.

For more information on the Model Context Protocol, please see the [official Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp).
