        <p>Views are the local, non-synchronized part of a Multisynq Application. Each device and browser window creates its own independent local view. The view [subscribes]<a href="#viewsubscribe">View#subscribe</a> to events [published]<a href="#modelpublish">Model#publish</a> by the synchronized model, so it stays up to date in real time. What the view is showing, however, is completely up to the application developer. The view can adapt to the device it's running on and show very different things. <strong>Multisynq makes no assumptions about the UI framework you use</strong> - be it plain HTML or Three.js or React or whatever. Multisynq only provides the publish/subscribe mechanism to hook into the synchronized model simulation. It's possible for a single view instance to handle all the events, you don't event have to subclass Multisynq.View for that. That being said, a common pattern is to make a hierarchy of <code>Multisynq.View</code> subclasses to mimic your hierarchy of <a href="#model">Model</a> subclasses.</p>

                <p>A View instance is created in <a href="#sessionjoin">Session.join</a>, and the root model is passed into its constructor. This inherited constructor does not use the model in any way. Your constructor should recreate the view state to exactly match what is in the model.

Typically, a view would also subscribe to the browser's or framework's input events, and in response [publish]<a href="#viewpublish">View#publish</a> events for the model to consume. The constructor will, however, register the view and assign it an [id]<a href="#viewid">View#id</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> When your view instance is no longer needed, you must [detach]<a href="#viewdetach">View#detach</a> it. Otherwise it will be kept in memory forever.</p>

                <p><strong>Publish an event to a scope.</strong> Events are the main form of communication between models and views in Multisynq. Both models and views can publish events, and subscribe to each other's events. Model-to-model and view-to-view subscriptions are possible, too. See [Model.subscribe]<a href="#modelsubscribe">Model#subscribe</a> for a discussion of <strong>scopes</strong> and <strong>event names</strong>. Optionally, you can pass some <strong>data</strong> along with the event. For events published by a view and received by a model, the data needs to be serializable, because it will be sent via the reflector to all users. For view-to-view events it can be any value or object. Note that there is no way of testing whether subscriptions exist or not (because models can exist independent of views). Publishing an event that has no subscriptions is about as cheap as that test would be, so feel free to always publish, there is very little overhead.</p>

              subscribe(scope, eventSpec, eventSpec.event, eventSpec.handling, handler): this
              ```
              <div className="method-description">
                <p><strong>Register an event handler for an event published to a scope.</strong> Both <code>scope</code> and <code>event</code> can be arbitrary strings. Typically, the scope would select the object (or groups of objects) to respond to the event, and the event name would select which operation to perform. A commonly used scope is <code>this.id</code> (in a model) and <code>model.id</code> (in a view) to establish a communication channel between a model and its corresponding view. Unlike in a model's [subscribe]<a href="#modelsubscribe">Model#subscribe</a> method, you can specify when the event should be handled: - <strong>Queued:</strong> The handler will be called on the next run of the [main loop]<a href="#sessionjoin">Session.join</a>, the same number of times this event was published. This is useful if you need each piece of data that was passed in each [publish]<a href="#modelpublish">Model#publish</a> call. An example would be log entries generated in the model that the view is supposed to print. Even if more than one log event is published in one render frame, the view needs to receive each one. <strong><code>{ event: "name", handling: "queued" }</code> is the default.  Simply specify <code>"name"</code> instead.</strong> - <strong>Once Per Frame:</strong> The handler will be called only <em>once</em> during the next run of the [main loop]<a href="#sessionjoin">Session.join</a>. If [publish]<a href="#modelpublish">Model#publish</a> was called multiple times, the handler will only be invoked once, passing the data of only the last <code>publish</code> call. For example, a view typically would only be interested in the current position of a model to render it. Since rendering only happens once per frame, it should subscribe using the <code>oncePerFrame</code> option. The event typically would be published only once per frame anyways, however, while the model is catching up when joining a session, this would be fired rapidly. <strong><code>{ event: "name", handling: "oncePerFrame" }</code> is the most efficient option, you should use it whenever possible.</strong> - <strong>Immediate:</strong> The handler will be invoked <em>synchronously</em> during the [publish]<a href="#modelpublish">Model#publish</a> call. This will tie the view code very closely to the model simulation, which in general is undesirable. However, if the event handler needs to set up another subscription, immediate execution ensures that a subsequent publish will be properly handled (especially when rapidly replaying events for a new user). Similarly, if the view needs to know the exact state of the model at the time the event was published, before execution in the model proceeds, then this is the facility to allow this without having to copy model state. Pass <code>{event: "name", handling: "immediate"}</code> to enforce this behavior. The <code>handler</code> can be any callback function. Unlike a model's [handler]<a href="#modelsubscribe">Model#subscribe</a> which must be a method of that model, a view's handler can be any function, including fat-arrow functions declared in-line. Passing a method like in the model is allowed too, it will be bound to <code>this</code> in the subscribe call.</p>

                <p><strong>Identifies the View of the current user.</strong> All users in a session share the same Model (meaning all model objects) but each user has a different View (meaning all the non-model state). The <code>viewId</code> identifies each user's view, or more specifically, their connection to the server. It is sent as argument in the model-only [<code>"view-join"</code> event]<a href="#event:view-join">event:view-join</a> and [<code>"view-exit"</code> event]<a href="#event:view-exit">event:view-exit</a>. The <code>viewId</code> is also used as a scope for local events, for example the [<code>"synced"</code> event]<a href="#event:synced">event:synced</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> <code>this.viewId</code> is different from [<code>this.id</code>]<a href="#viewid">View#id</a> which identifies each individual view object (if you create multiple views in your code). <code>this.viewId</code> identifies the local user, so it will be the same in each individual view object. See [<code>"view-join"</code> event]<a href="#event:view-join">event:view-join</a>.</p>
