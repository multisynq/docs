# Events

Multisynq uses an event-driven architecture to communicate between models and views.

## Core Events

### `synced`

Fired when the view has synchronized with the model state.

**Usage:**
```javascript
view.subscribe("synced", () => {
    console.log("View is synchronized");
});
```

### `view-join`

Fired when a new view joins the session.

**Parameters:**
- `viewId` (string) - The ID of the joining view

**Usage:**
```javascript
model.subscribe("view-join", viewId => {
    console.log(`View ${viewId} joined`);
});
```

### `view-exit`

Fired when a view leaves the session.

**Parameters:**
- `viewId` (string) - The ID of the exiting view

**Usage:**
```javascript
model.subscribe("view-exit", viewId => {
    console.log(`View ${viewId} left`);
});
```

## Custom Events

You can create and use custom events:

```javascript
// In the model
this.publish("my-custom-event", { data: "value" });

// In the view
this.subscribe("my-custom-event", data => {
    console.log("Received:", data);
});
```

## Event Handling Options

### Queued (Default)
```javascript
view.subscribe("event-name", handler);
// or explicitly:
view.subscribe({ event: "event-name", handling: "queued" }, handler);
```

### Once Per Frame
```javascript
view.subscribe({ event: "event-name", handling: "oncePerFrame" }, handler);
```

### Immediate
```javascript
view.subscribe({ event: "event-name", handling: "immediate" }, handler);
```
