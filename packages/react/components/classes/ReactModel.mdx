## ReactModel

<a id="reactmodel"></a>
<p><strong>Extends:</strong> <code>Model</code></p>
<p>This class extends the Multisynq [Model](../client/Model.html) class to automatically update React state when the model changes. We recommend that your models inherit from this class, as it requires less code, but you can still use the Model class. Keep in mind that if you do, you won't be able to use the <a href="#usereactmodelroot">useReactModelRoot</a> hook, and will have to publish and subscribe to the input and output events on your own. For more details about this, please check the [Event overview](../client/index.html#events) and the [View.publish](../client/View.html#publish), [Model.subscribe](../client/Model.html#subscribe), [Model.publish](../client/Model.html#publish), and [View.subscribe](../client/View.html#subscribe) methods.</p>
