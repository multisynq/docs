## llms.txt

This file provides instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated agents on how to best interact with the content on `docs.multisynq.io`.

### User-Agent

All automated agents should identify themselves with a `User-Agent` that includes a reference to the service they are operating on behalf of.

### Allowed Paths

-   All paths under `/docs/` are allowed for crawling and indexing for the purpose of answering user questions.

### Disallowed Paths

-   There are currently no disallowed paths for reading/indexing.

### Preferred Content Representation

-   For the most accurate and structured information, agents should prefer to use the raw Markdown version of pages when available through the contextual menu (`View as Markdown`).
-   The semantic structure of the HTML (headings, lists, tables) should be used to understand the information hierarchy.

This page serves as a placeholder for a future, more detailed `llms.txt` implementation. For more information on the `llms.txt` standard, please visit the official resources.
